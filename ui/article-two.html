                    This is the content of my second article and I want to again mention about Rava.
                
                <p>
                    She is sooo beautiful. When she is walking towards me and when I stare at her, that smile on her face with an expression of blush + little bit of showing anger to scare me not to see her and that hair which covers upper right corner of her forehead. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    That day she was too beautiful. That smile and that expression of feeling shy. Abaaahhhh I feel so lucky that I get that expression and no one else.
