                    This is the content of my third article and I want to mention about Rava again. I don't know how the situation will be like after B.Tech. Life will test all of us. I just pray to God that he doesn't deviate my mind and I shouldn't do anything stupid to spoil everything between us.

                    She was very honest from her side and she told she doesn't want to continue because she also knows how the life will be after B Tech. I mean she knows it is very uncertain and very hard and sometimes very easy, life will be and she is also afraid that how will she cope up with me when life comes like that.

                    That's why she wanted to end. But it was me who convinced her and it was me who made her to believe that everything will go good. So now its my responsibility that I shouldn't allow both of us to fail. Obviously I have to look on to me to not fail because I was the one who convinced but alongwith me since me and her are same, I have to look after her as well and support her full time and be like a cushion and never make her to believe that something is going wrong. Just make sure everything goes good.
