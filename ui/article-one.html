                    This is the content of my first article and I want to mention about Rava. I don't want to make her unhappy and I want her to be happy whenver I am there. If she is unhappy in presence of me then what's the use of me being there.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    May be she is tense right now or may be something else is going in her mind. Or some kind of realisation she got it again. I hope she gets fine soon.
                </p>

                    Just wait till tomorrow Rava, Varsha is coming tomorrow and you will be too happy to see her. I know you are bored Rava and you want to go home. I don't want you to get bored. I want to see that smiling Rava. I thought so many times to tell you about Varsha's arrival so that you smile and there is some excitement in your life but I am just waiting for that instantaneous response of yours when you see her. I'm waiting for that and I hope everything goes successful.
